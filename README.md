      Maybe display all questions, but only current question big      
      Maybe only give access to previous questions via a dialog

2,  Design opening introduction page

3,  Design question choice page

      Question type
      Question level
      Number of questions

4,  Bring in question generation from Gtk3 repository

5,  See how to package files
      Is it possible to include latex with the file?

6,  Create a helper file that has methods to help with images
      Change the size of the image so that it is a fixed size

7,  Create a questions class that contains objects of the required question type

8,  The required question object needs to have:
        a question
        an answer
        an image
        a way of checking a users answer
