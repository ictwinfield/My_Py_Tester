# My_Py_Tester
Here I will create my PyQt Tester program

1,  Design the look of the question page
      
      Maybe display all questions, but only current question big      
      Maybe only give access to previous questions via a dialog

2,  Design opening introduction page

3,  Design question choice page
      
      Question type
      Question level
      Number of questions

4,  Bring in question generation from Gtk3 repository

5,  See how to package files
      Is it possible to include latex with the file?
